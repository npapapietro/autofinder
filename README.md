Autofinder for Meade LX70
The Meade LX70 Telescope has slowmotion controls that are connected by a RJ11 (R4P4) connector from a control box.  Here I am designing an autofinder that will import data from http://theskylive.com for included objects and automatically use the slowmotion controls to find it in the sky. This is in the early stages. 
Current Stage:
1) Writing base catalog
2) Hardware - The slowmotion generators run on 4 D-Cell batteries and take a RJ11 type connector. The USB we have would be using a what I believe is a RJ45. We would have 2-4 redundant data wires.
