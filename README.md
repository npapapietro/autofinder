# autofinder

## Project Proposal

The Meade Lx70 series telescope and similar Celestron AstroMaster series telescopes rely on two stepper motors to slowly move and track objects via a control box. 

A link to the Amazon webpage: https://www.amazon.com/Celestron-93522-Motor-Drive-Advanced/dp/B0000C3WBB/ref=sr_1_1?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1487715472&sr=1-1&keywords=dual+axis+motor

In this project, we propose to control the motors via Raspberry Pi to allow for autofinding objects in the sky. 

## Current Status: 2/21/17

The micro controller chips are enroute as are the proper connectors (I ordered incorrect ones previously). Collaborators are being taught a crash course in Python as well so nothing more than what's up on this page has been added. Maybe one week from now we'll have the hardware setup.
